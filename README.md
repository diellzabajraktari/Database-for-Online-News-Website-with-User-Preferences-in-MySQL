# Database-for-Online-News-Website-with-User-Preferences-in-MySQL
In this project, I designed and implemented a robust database system for an online news website, incorporating user preferences. 
Using MySQL, I developed an efficient schema to store various news articles, user profiles, and their preferences.
The database allows users to personalize their news feed based on their interests, providing a tailored browsing experience. 
By leveraging MySQL's features, such as relational tables and queries, I ensured seamless data management and retrieval, enabling the website to deliver 
relevant and engaging content to users.
